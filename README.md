## bm

- Create a tool to manage directoris as bookmark.
### TODO
- [X] Create the project
```
cargo new --vcs none bm
```
- [ ] Start by following the [Rust CLI tutorial](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/setup.html)

- [ ] Next steps is to transform it to allow
  - `bm -l`: list all available bookmarks
  - `bm -d <bookmark name>`: delete the bookmark
  - `bm -a <bookmark name>`: add the current directory as a bookmark named *named*
  - bookmarks will be stored in a file like **.bm.yml**.
  

## Codingame

- Created using:
```
cargo new --vcs none codingame
```

- Most of exercices are taken from [coding game](https://www.codingame.com)
- Maybe have a look to [code wars](https://www.codewars.com)

## Monads

- Created using:
```
cargo new --vcs none monads
```
- It is a video found on youtube that explains monads by example but I don't
  remember which one it is.
